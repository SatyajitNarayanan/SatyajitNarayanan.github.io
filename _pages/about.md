======
I am currently working as a Data Scientist at Tanger Outlets, based out of Greensboro, NC. 

I am leading the Data Science efforts of the company by helping design smarter marketing campaigns and helping make strategic decisions using data-driven methods. It's a new and exciting journey and I hope to learn a lot from this experience.

Before joining Tanger, I completed my Master's in Operations Research at North Carolina State University where I learnt in depth about optimization, stochastic processes and machine learning and have a Master's in Economics degree from the University of Mumbai. I worked as a Decision scientist at Mu Sigma Inc. for close to 3 years where I enabled Fortune 500 clients to solve business problems by making inferences from analysis outcomes and communicating recommendations to clients based upon these inferences.

My interests include Behavioral Science, Decision Making, Economics and policy!
