I am currently working as a Data Scientist at Tanger Outlets, Greensboro,NC.

Before joining Tanger, I completed my Master’s in Operations Research at North Carolina State University learning in depth about optimization, stochastic processes and machine learning. I have a Bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering and a Master’s in Economics – both from the University of Mumbai, India.

I also worked as a Decision scientist at Mu Sigma Inc. for three years, enabling many of their Fortune 500 clients to solve business problems using data analytics & ML.

My interests include Behavioral Science, Decision Making, Economics and policy.
