## using Machine Learning & Lexicon-Based methods

This project is on twitter sentimental analysis by combining lexicon based and machine learning approaches. I was part of this project with a group of other students as a part of the Data Mining course at North Carolina State University. A supervised lexicon-based approach for extracting sentiments from tweets was implemented. Various supervised machine learning approaches were tested using scikit-learn libraries in python and implemented Decision Trees and Naive Bayes techniques.

The entire code for pre-processing, implementation and post-processing of the project was done in Python 2.7
